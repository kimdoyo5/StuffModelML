## Checklist
- Filter for pitch types for which pitchers have thrown 10+ of each year (due to arm_angles and spin_directions dataset restriction)
- What to do about NA's?

## TO-DO
- [X] Pitch-by-Pitch Arm Angle Estimation
- [X] Pitch-by-Pitch Gyro Angle Estimation
- [X] CleanSavantData.py
- [ ] Trajectory Calculator & Late Movement Calculator (Optional)
- [ ] Model Outline
- [ ] Combine the data into one main dataset so, we need to combine the data that exists plus the data Tom created into one dataset
- [ ] We also need to get the RA9 of all the pitchers and match it to the data
- [ ] Attach the label, so for each data point there should be the last years RA9 and then the label should be this years RA9






## What Each Part Does

### Pitch-by-Pitch Arm Angle Estimation
Currently, BaseballSavant only offers average arm angle for a pitcher, for each year.  
'Pitch-by-Pitch Arm Angle Estimation' estimates pitch-by-pitch arm angle based on release_pos_x and release_pos_z.

Because MLB pitchers are elite athletes, they efficiently rotate in a single plane; their arm swing is in the same plane as torso rotation; wrist and shoulder movement planes are in line with each other.  

ArmAngleEstimator.py assumes the "pivot point" to be roughly 0.5 "lever lengths" from shoulder
- pivot point: point where the wrist/shoulder rotates around
- lever length: distance from shoulder to ball 
    - (think of drawing a straight line from ball to shoulder, then extending 0.5x further into the middle of the body)

AddArmAnglesToSavant.py standardizes that to absolute x-z coordinates (from the relative points in arm_angles_YYYY.csv)

When release_pos_z is higher, or release_pos_x is more gloveside, the estimated_arm_angle is higher.  The opposite is true for lower/armside.

When the pitcher releases the ball later (i.e. more release_extension), both release_pos_x and release_pos_z will drop (closer to pivot point)â€”so the arm angle doesn't change much. 

### Pitch-by-Pitch Gyro Angle Estimation  
Currently, BaseballSavant only offers average "active spin" for a given pitch type, pitcher, and year.  
'Pitch-by-Pitch Gyro Angle Estimation' estimates pitch-by-pitch gyro angle based on:
- pitch_type_gyro_deg: inferred from active_spin
- release_speed_diff: release_speed change from average (for pitcher's pitch_type's year)
- spin_direction_diff: spin_direction change from average (for pitcher's pitch_type's year)
- spin_rate_diff: spin_rate change from average (for pitcher's pitch_type's year)
- arm_angle_diff: arm_angle change from average (for pitcher's pitch_type's year)
- ssw_tilt: inferred - observed spin axis

The predictor variables were fit to a linear model, categorized by: Fastball, Breaking, Offspeed
(Pitches that were 'none of the above' were noted NA.)
- Fastball: Multiple R^2:  0.3801, Adjusted R^2:  0.3799, p-value: < 2.2e-16
- Breaking: Multiple R^2:  0.6783, Adjusted R^2:  0.6782, p-value: < 2.2e-16
- Offspeed: No correlations
    - Unfortunately, offspeeds showed no relationships even when split into reverse/non-reverse categories
- We found no other models to be superior; this model doesn't appear to overfit.

*Screwballs are assumed to have reverse gyro; Sinkers if their SSW goes in opposite direction; Changeups if they have lower efficiency than the pitcher's highest-efficiency fastball.
All other pitches are assumed to have non-reverse gyro.
